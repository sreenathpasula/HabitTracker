Notion-Inspired Design
Clean, distraction-free UI with a personalized name tag for a focused habit-tracking experience.

Habit Management
Add, rename, or delete habits directly within the grid—no extra forms or modals.

Time-Aware Dark Mode
Automatically switches between light and dark themes based on the time of day, with a manual toggle for user control.

Habit Insights Summary
A dedicated insights section showing overall completion rate, top-performing habits, and monthly effort.

Interactive Audio Feedback
